## Backend Setup (Flask + Colab + Ngrok)
1. Open the file `rag_flower_chatbot.ipynb` in Kaggle.
2. Make sure to add your `ngrok_key` and `together_api_key`.
3. Run the cell `0.Packages` to install all the dependencies.
4. Run `Data Crawling` to crawl the data if you havenâ€™t done so already.
5. Run `Data Preprocessing` to preprocess the data and perform basic transformations.
6. Run `Retriever Module`, `Answer Generator`, and `Agent Tools` to execute all the components of the RAG pipeline.
7. Run `API` and set the Ngrok URL in the Streamlit files.
